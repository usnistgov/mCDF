# mCDF - Compact serialization for voting common data formats

This repository holds the NIST Special Publication 1500-19 Micro Common Data Format (mCDF) Specification Version 1 and supporting files.

SP 1500-19 is also available using the following Digital Object Identifier (DOI):

https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1500-19

The format seeks to support the following election scenarios:

1. Exchange of activation information between ballot activation devices and ballot marking devices;
2. exchange of contest option selections between ballot marking devices and ballot scanners;
3. exchange of ballot style identifier information between full-face paper ballots and scanners; and
4. other applications that require software independent (e.g. paper) information exchange.

Please contact the [NIST Voting Team](mailto:voting@nist.gov) with questions and for more information.
